<!-- ======================================= FLOWS =============================================== -->

<!-- JS doesn't need compulsory semicolon insertion because it folllows automatic 
 semi-colon insertion.
 
 the moment the document understand the content is ready , much before the body can even call onload function
 this gets called (fun3) ---fastest way to access
 
 then the window gets called
 
 then the body, attaching an event to the body is the laziest thing to do in the sense the body would have 
 already displayed in the screen then the functio is called-->

 <!-- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->

 <!-- fun 4 have been created faster compared to the other 3 , it didn't waint for the body's content 
  to be loaded -- but it doesn't make it better
   -->

<!-- fun 4 when it was called there was several other tags that were not created. but when DOMContnent was loaded 
    everyhting i mean all the elements were created -->
